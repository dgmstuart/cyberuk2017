- Security is better when it focusses on helping people to do things well, not punishing them for doing things wrong
- Embedding security experts in delivery teams yields good results

- For Pen Tests, we list the sort of things that should not be possible - e.g.
  for an attacker to be able to do something on an admin account. Should we
  have these at the very beginning? Maintained alongside stories?
