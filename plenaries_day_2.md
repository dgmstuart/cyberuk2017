# Plenary talks day 2

## Alex Dewdney, Director Engagement, NCSC

- Focus: interection of tech and people IRL

## Claudia Natanson, Chief Security Officer, DWP

- UC is Europe's largest online payment system
- 6k servers, 100k devices, lots of them ageing
  - migration is challenging

### Drivers for change

- Change in usage by users and potential employees
- Responding to user needs rather than deciding far in advance what should be
  built
- Data sizes massively increased
- DDoS are frequent and huge

### Doing the change

- Security people embedded into sprint teams (PDUs)
- 'Shadow IT' - go to third party SaaS and devices because they help get the
  work done in a way which isn't possible with tools provided by (and managed
  by) the organisation
- << Seems to have a different idea about what devops is - focused on
  delivering tools >>

### Risk-based approach

- Rather than a binary yes/no, understand the risks: mitigate them or decide
  to accept them
- Aggregating information about incidents, threats  and claims alongside
  risks: information aggregated allows an understanding of risk appetite

### Security capability drivers

- Need to be "Breach-ready"
- "Leading from the top" in terms of education around e.g. spearphishing:
  ensuring that the top people in the organisation have good understanding
- Use big data analytics to whittle down the huge numbers of potential
  incidents to ~100 which can be investigated as likely incidents

### Challenges

- Agile vs Security tension: need to have the same deadlines, be on the same
  team. Discussion is around managing risk not blocking.
  - driven by demand and risk
- Remove accreditation step: risk assessment needs to be done throughout
- Risk in the supply chain: other orgs risks aren't in your control
- People are _responsible_ but not _accountable_


## People: The Strongest Link - Emma W, NCSC

- Diverse skills needed to address the really hard problems
- We haven't put nearly enough research into how people function wrt security
  - focus has been on trying to 'fix the user'
- Punishing users for falling for phishing attempts doesn't make sense
  - some are really good!
  - wastes time and money
  - hurts users
  - doesn't change anything!!
- We ask users to decide whether they trust emails - how are they supposed to
  do that
- No evidence that regular password changes help to make accounts more secure
- We understand tech more than we understand people, so we make the tech then
  ask people to come to it
- "Security must work for people, because if security doesn't work for people,
  it doesn't work"
- Policies are often a stick to beat people with when they do things wrong -
  not a tool to help them to do things right
- "People are the _only_ link"

### Video

- When your employees bend the rules, they're trying to tell you something
